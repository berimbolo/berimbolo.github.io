[John Cleese on Stealing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA-mIE6ygC4).

Probably an underappreciated, but necessary practice. But it's fundamental to learning, spend significant time with a toddler (live I have with my nephew) and you'll see how quick they are to mirror behavior and mannerism you exhibit. 
Leave them alone and you'll see how quickly they'll unmake things, make a mess, mostly to explore. They literally don't know what will happen if they do something, so they do it. 

Their brains are little learning machines, it's quite impressive actually.

Anyway, I've been doing a lot of that lately, just looking at code of sites I like and seeing how they work. Try to emulate it, change it around, break it, then unbreaking. It's easier than staring at an empty text editor and going "well now what?".
