I've been busy at my job the last 2-3 months, working 40 hours a week or more.
It has more or less, slowed my coding work to snail pace compared to what it was before. Mostly, I've been working through Free Code Camp's bonfire challenges. Since it's a good way to sit down for an 30-60 minutes a day and work on solving them. 

Like writing a function that finds the longest word in a sentence

```javascript
function findLongestWord(str) {
  var splitArray = str.split(" ");
  var wordLengths = [];
  var longestWordLength = [];

  for (var i=0; i < splitArray.length; i++){
        wordLengths.push(splitArray[i].length);
	}
  for (var j=0; j < wordLengths.length; j++){
  while (longestWordLength < wordLengths[j]){
      longestWordLength[0] = wordLengths[j];
    }
         }
  return (longestWordLength[0]);
}
findLongestWord("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog");
```

I showed this to my friend/mentor Art who's been coaching me with programming and who's a full time senior front end developer.
He said "Good, but this is better". I find this helpful, because then I sit there and reconstruct his code mentally and see how he works it out and we sit and usually talk about why it's better. Or more like, he interrogates socratically to see if I understand why his way is better.

```javascript
function findLongestWordBetter(str){
  var longestString = '';
  str.split(' ').map(function(val, i){
	  if (val.length > longestString.length){
      longestString = val;
    }
  })
  return longestString.length;
}
```
