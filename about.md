My name is Alex Ruiz. I've been serious learning web development for the last two years, mostly on my own and with a little help from my friends. Although, before that I would regularly make my own websites and had a regular on and off relationship with Linux. But about two years ago, I saw the opportunities for someone with my skills and interest. My best friend, a front end developer himself recommended it as well telling "You know, back in school you used to know more than me" and it's true, I'm the one that told him that layouts based on tables were lame and that CSS was the way forward and showed him CSS Zen Garden.

Since then, I've pretty much read every variation of the "How do I become a Front End developer" question that seems to pop up in Quora and /r/webDev all the time and everytime I've grabbed the best answers and try to follow them best I could.

* Started with catching up on the latest developments on HTML5 and my old friend CSS3.

* Worked with Vanilla Javascript and remembered it being easier than when I tried learning it in high school. Maybe I'm just smarter? Or maybe, my teachers we're right, I really wasn't applying myself hard enough.

* Tried jQuery for the first time. It was like going from stick shift to fully automatic.
