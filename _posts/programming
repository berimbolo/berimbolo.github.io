So I think I've discovered that I enjoy working with programming than I do with html/css. I enjoy solving a programming problem so much more than I enjoy trying to get divs to work just so and learning how to hack browsers so they display correctly. Not that I wouldn't do that job if someone paid me to do it, I've certainly have had jobs that were less fun. But ideally, I'd want to be a full-time programmer.

Art, who encouraged me to learn javascript and pursue the path of a front end developer has said that I'm ready to apply for jobs. I'm not sure if I 100% agree, I feel like I still don't know enough. But he assures me that I know more than he knew, when he first got hired at a startup. So maybe he's right?
