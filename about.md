My name is Alex Ruiz. I've been serious learning web development for the last two years, mostly on my own and with a little help from my friends. Although, before that I would regularly make my own websites and had a regular on and off relationship with Linux. But about two years ago, I saw the opportunities for someone with my skills and interest.[^1]Also, I was working as a dogwalker and one day, I found myself musing, "I am literally shoveling shit right now. I shit shoveler, how did I reach this point?"
I've pretty much read every variation of the "How do I become a Front End developer" question that seems to pop up in Quora and /r/webDev all the time and everytime I've grabbed the best answers and try to follow them best I could.
