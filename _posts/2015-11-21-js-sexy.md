title: javaScript is Sexy.
---

So in learning javaScript there's been a few stop and starts along the way.
I tried working through codeacademy guide and it I finished it, but I think the problem is that it gives you too many hints and there's a discussion forum with all the answers. Don't get me wrong, I think the information and content is a great primer and it goes over alot of the major concepts and does a good job in introducing them.
But if at the end of finishing up the JS module, you're given a simple task like creating a to do app from scratch, you're gonna go "oh crap, how did that go again".

Which is exactly what happned to me when Art told me to build a simple todo app. After few hours of work, I managed it. I built it via jQuery and it simply added items to the page and then removed then. He said "great, now do it with an array and create the items into an object". This took me longer than a few hours, it actually took a lot of attempts and a lot of stop and start. It probably took me closer to two weeks to finish. I was pretty proud of myself and then he told me "You know, this is something I'd expect someone to be able to do from scratch in 15-20 minutes at a job interview".
So there were definitely holes in my javaScript game, but then I discovered this page.

I ordered the book they reccomended: [Professional JavaScript for Web Developers by Nicholas C. Zakas](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1118026691/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_Nypuwb11GBHK).

And also this one, [JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development by Jon Duckett](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1118531647/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_Jrquwb0B43JJB) 
because while Zakas's book is a great reference and often times, I read it and go "Oh, the answer is here. I should have just looked here first instead of googled the crap of out of the question and have to sort the wheat from chaff and saved myself 10 minutes".
But as great of reference, it lacks in tutorials and any sort of handholding. Duckett is better in that respect, also the graphic design/layout is top notch and I'm a sucker for good design. It's almost pretty enough to be a coffee table book on its own.

It's supposed to be a 6 week process, which seems a bit ambitious I think. Maybe if you're devoting at least 8 hours a day of no screwing around, hardcore concentration, no grabassing on social media, then yes, I suppose it is possible to do it in 6 weeks. Maybe.

Anyway, back I remember looking at the requirements and feeling daunted. But I look over it and now, I can pretty much do everything on the list.

>Week 6: Build a Real-World JavaScript Quiz Application
At this juncture, you have learned enough to build a solid JavaScript web application. Don’t proceed any further until you can successfully build this application I describe below. Don’t be afraid to ask questions on Stack Overflow, and do reread sections of the book to properly understand the concepts.

>You are building a JavaScript quiz web application (you will use HTML and CSS as well) that will function as follows:

>It is a simple quiz that has radio button choices, and it will show the quiz taker his or her score upon completion.
The quiz can show any number of questions and any number of choices.
Tally the user’s score and display the final score on the last page. The last page will only show the score, so remove the last question.
Use an array to store all the questions. Each question, along with its choices and correct answer, should be stored in an object. The array of questions should look similar to this (Notice that only one question is in this example array; you will add many questions):
var allQuestions = [{question: "Who is Prime Minister of the United Kingdom?", choices: ["David Cameron", "Gordon Brown", "Winston Churchill", "Tony Blair"], correctAnswer:0}];
Dynamically (with document.getElementById or jQuery) remove the current question and add the next question, when the user clicks the “Next” button. The Next button will be the only button to navigate this version of the quiz.
You can ask for help in the comments below or preferably on Stack Overflow. You will likely to get a prompt and accurate answer on Stack Overflow.
Improve Your Quiz
You should be very comfortable with JavaScript, probably feeling like a Jedi. No, you are not. Not yet. You must keep using your newly acquired knowledge and skills as often as possible to keep learning and improving.

>Improve Your Quiz Application From Earlier:

>Add client-side data validation: make sure the user answers each question before proceeding to the next question.
Add a “Back” button to allow the user to go back and change her answer. The user can go back up to the first question. For the questions that the user has answered already, be sure to show the radio button selected, so that the user is not forced to answer the questions again, which she has completed.
>Use jQuery to add animation (fade out the current question and fade in the next question).
>Test the quiz on IE 9, and fix any bugs. This will give you a good workout 😉
>Store the quiz questions in an external JSON file.
>Add user authentication: allow users to log in, and save their login credentials to local storage (HTML5 browser storage).
>Use cookies to remember the user, and show a “Welcome, ‘First Name'” message when the user returns to the quiz.

None of that seems daunting, I have a pretty good idea of how to do everything specified on the list.

It's probably taken me 6 months, but that's with working 35-40hrs a week and training 8-10 hours a week. 
My days usually consist of getting up, going to work for 7-0 hours, head home and quickly change and eat, then head to the gym for 2-3 hours, come back, eat again and then work on coding until I pass out. It's kind of exhausting at times, but at the same time I've never been more productive in my life.
